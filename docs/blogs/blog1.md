# Close Connections and Far Away Obsessions


## Hunch

I would like to explore building a social media platform that reinforces and supplements existing close relationships and allows for users of all types to meaningfully connect with their communities. 

## Interview Prep

In thinking about an app that looks to reinforce real life connections, I immediately thought of interviewing a family. In this way, I could not only compare generational divides in social media uses, but also explore what social media use within a well connected social circle would look like, and what features could make such an application meaningful. 

## The Interviewees

Within my own family, I was able to find two very diverse perspectives - Father and Daughter. 

My sister, Cara, is 18 years old and is a Senior in high school who enjoys riding her bike, dancing, listening to music, and keeping touch with her friends. She also has intellectual and developmental disabilities resulting from [Hydrocephalus](https://www.ninds.nih.gov/health-information/disorders/hydrocephalus) that causes her to struggle with reading and writing. Her unique perspective is representative of many of the attributes I would like my key audience to include. Cara is young, and surrounded by a community she loves but currently struggles to connect with when they are not in person due to her disability. Her challenges in communication also provide excellent insight into how a social media app could be made to be more inclusive of all members in a community or family.

Ben, my father, is an IT professional with a penchant for Baby Yoda memes and Kendrick-Drake beef. He is a veteran of the internet who joined Facebook in its early days, and even spent the pandemic curating a facebook meme page for his friends “for the lols”. He is a politically conscious and technologically savvy person, but represents an older generation that most up-and-coming social media platforms don’t tend to account for. As a father his perspective is additionally interesting due to the complexities of communicating with and raising his daughter in a social media driven age.

## Cara – Daughter

Cara is a highly social teenager. She is adamant about keeping up with online trends through YouTube, the only social media app she currently uses. At all hours of the day, you can find her oscillating between her content sources and her community, whom she primarily reaches through texting, or voice-messaging for more complex thoughts that she struggles to translate into writing. In talking with Cara, I discovered that she had not much considered social media beyond its mysterious allure. She recognizes a desire to connect and engage with her favorite YouTubers, like “ Lucas and Marcus”, alongside a desire to keep up with her friends and family members, particularly to send them funny pictures. Existing social media platforms are truly not built with her in mind – they are designed to require complex communication, with rapidly changing interfaces, language, and contexts that are overwhelming, leaving her perfectly content with a more solitary media experience. This opens up an opportunity to explore a design with people like Cara in mind, perhaps pared down and centered on ease of information, coupled with empowering them to share the media they choose.  Additionally, Cara expressed that she is frustrated that her parents don’t allow her to have additional social media, explaining that “they don’t trust me to not be mean or see mean things” but that she wants to “be a nice friend and send silly pictures” – something she believes social media would allow her to do. Her perspective is confirmed by the growing concern around the safety of children on social media across the internet. In this design, it would be paramount to make careful design choices about things like parental controls and moderation. Without careful implementation of these systems, Cara would be unlikely to ever have access to the platform, as it would not be in her best interest from the perspective of her parents.

## Ben – Father

Ben is an avid social media user. He uses it frequently in his spare time and currently describes his usage as “90% YouTube, and 10% Facebook. This YouTube dominant consumption is in spite of a storied past with the app, beginning when it first overtook myspace for the most dominant social network. Despite his storied history on Facebook, he told me that after the assassination attempt on former president Donald Trump, his feed was overtaken with political posts and advertisements driving him from the platform and onto YouTube, where, according to him ”it's about stuff that I actually care about”.
Throughout our conversation, he expressed a disdain for the centralization of social media platforms into companies rather than communities. As he put it ““Coming from my generation, I am so over social media, it is one of the four horsemen of the apocalypse” he also later added that he “want[s] to go back to the early days of Facebook when you could just see your friends’ and family’s posts.” In general, it seems that Ben enjoys a more private experience on social media, summarized well by his statement: “I don't need to broadcast everything to the world.” This testimony echoes  something uncovered in my chat with Cara, that a pared down, media driven experience would appeal to many people. 
Aside from a subpar experience, my dad finds the lack of a suitable communication platform with Cara frustrating. They have adapted to her needs as best as they can, but the divide between their Android and iPhone devices complicates the process. He explained that to send her voice messages, he has to jump through hoops: open his voice memos, record, download it, then upload them back into MMS texting. This further underscores a need to ensure the accessibility of the platform, which includes things from physical access to supporting alternate technologies.

## Design Opportunities

- Accessibility
	In targeting close social circles, and families in particular, it is incredibly important to take into account a wide variety of user abilities. The design should allow for users of wide physical abilities to meaningfully interact. For example, in Cara’s case, the ability to socialize through voice messages would be an interesting consideration. Also, simple, accessible media sharing for things like the silly photos she wants to share.

- Content Moderation/ Parental Control
	To allow for families to interact, it would be necessary for content to be properly moderated. However, different circles will have different needs, so the platform should allow users to set their own content moderation preferences. Families might require more oversight, while adult friend groups may prefer less. In a similar vein, to empower users like Cara to connect with their communities, it would be important for parents to have parental control options to protect their children according to their preferences.

- Content Sharing
	Given the platform’s emphasis on reinforcing real-world relationships, content generation is secondary to content sharing. As such, smooth integration with other platforms can ensure users can share meaningful content across communities.
